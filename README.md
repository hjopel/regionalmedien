## Development

From your terminal:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

## Considerations

Pagination + sorting together works as designed. Once a new search is performed, the pagination is reset to the first page & the sorting is reset to the default.

## Additional info

This is the basic example for the interview process. Due to time limitations, I was not able to implement the following:

- a nice looking UI (especially sort button(s))
- Tests (I would have used Jest as suggested by the docs)
