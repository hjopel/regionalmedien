## Development

From your terminal:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

## Additional info
This is the basic example for the interview process. Due to time limitations, I was not able to implement the following:
- a nice looking sort button with dropdown
- Tests (I would have used Jest as suggested by the docs)
